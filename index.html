As an expert in Vehicle dynamics and Control Systems for the Automotive, my focus as a Mechatronics Engineer is optimizing vehicle performance through system simulation and ride and handling analysis using Multibody Dynamics. 
With a Master's degree in Vehicle Dynamics and a profound understanding of this field, I have honed my MATLAB/Simulink, MSC ADAMS, SIMPACK, and Python skills to deliver innovative solutions that enhance vehicle control and improve system performance. 
My passion for research drives me to contribute to the evolution of control systems for safer and more efficient vehicles. I thrive in collaborative environments and work on delivering measurable results through analytical skills and practical strategies.
